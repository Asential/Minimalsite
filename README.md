Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


Hello, I have made a simple website with four pages with a minimalistic theme.
	
	Home - It contains a background Image and 3 bootstrap columns which link to the other 3 pages.
	Top Songs - It contains a table of some songs.
	Game List - It contains a list of games in card-format of bootstrap with each having list of points.
	Minimalistic Sites - It contains a grid of Images-Hyperlinks of some good minimalistic websites.


I have done the requirements as follows:

	1. The three pages are linked to the home page by the Home button and can be navigated.
	2. The Lists can be found on each at the Game Lists page.
	3. The Table can be found on the Songs page.
	4. Images can be found on the Home page as well as the Sites page
	5. I have used numerous css selectors(#content, body, a, col-4, .row, .row:after for example in ExtraStyles.css) and numerous css properties, some my own, some I have found on the internet.
	6. I have included @media queries in stylesheets which removes the background image/color and/or changes the font size.
	7. I have used Bootstrap columns on my home page and I have made the table and list-card using Bootstrap components.
	8. I have used scss which has variables(in ExtraStyles.scss), nesting(can be found in ExtraStyles.scss) and inheritence(used only in List.scss).

Details about the files:
	
	1. The html files are simple enough each having their own elements.
	2. ExtraStyles.css contains the css for animation of text and fonts.
	3. ExtraStylesTiles.css contains some more css used on the Tiles page.
	4. Tiles.css contians all the css for the tiles page.
	5. List.css contains css for the List page.
	6. Table.css contains the css for the table page(used a color inversion).
	7. Images folder contains the images of the background and the ones used in tiles page.
	8. css folder contains all the css.

I hope I have completed all the requirments!

Thank You
