    <div id="content">
      This site was made as a project for an online course. I have tried to implement the Minimalistic theme for the website. Following this line will be some filler text to make the website look like it contains some meaningful information. This is the said filler text which I have typed just as it has come to my mind. This is not copied from anywhere and is 100% original. I will keep typing till it looks "full" enough. I am about half-way there. I see that you have decided to read the filler text which means either that you are curious as to what kind of information I am putting here or you have too much free time. With that I suppose I can stop and hence I will do that!
